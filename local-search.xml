Machine learning is the AI that can self-improve. It studies computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<br>Its applications range from datamining programs that discover general rules in large data sets, to information filtering systems that automatically learn users’ interests. [1]</p><p>Precisely speaking, algorithmic trading is a very important branch of quantitative investing. It is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume [2]. It aims to reduce the friction of the market through using proper rules. </p><p>For algorithmic trading, machine learning is a powerful tool (method).</p><h3 id="Potential-and-Applications-SVM-Model-in-Algorithmic-Trading"><a href="#Potential-and-Applications-SVM-Model-in-Algorithmic-Trading" class="headerlink" title="Potential and Applications (SVM Model in Algorithmic Trading)"></a>Potential and Applications (SVM Model in Algorithmic Trading)</h3><p>There are many different machine learning strategies in algorithmic trading. And the SVM is one of the most widely used models.</p><h4 id="SVM-Support-Vector-Machine"><a href="#SVM-Support-Vector-Machine" class="headerlink" title="SVM (Support Vector Machine)"></a>SVM (Support Vector Machine)</h4><p>SVM is a supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It bases on statistical learning theory. It seeks to minimize structural risk while minimizing sample error. And it aims to improve generalization ability of the system.<br>The advantage of SVM algorithm is that it is optimized by parameters to reduce generalization error rate. It also uses kernel functions to learn in high-dimensional feature spaces to solve nonlinear classification and regression problems. [3]</p><p>The SVM timing model is actually a classifier. The processes it builds include: </p><ol><li>Collect data. For example, basic historical market information (opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, etc.); </li><li>Analyze data. Organize all feature items of the data. Remove duplicates to reduce data dimensions; </li><li>Train algorithm. Parameter tuning through using particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA); </li><li>Test algorithm. Back testing of the timing strategy is carried out after setting the Stop Loss level. Statistical model accuracy and yield. </li></ol><p>In general, the SVM classification algorithm is combined with other parameter optimization algorithms. By learning historical trading data with ups and downs, it can become a classifier that predicts the trend in a certain time interval of future. Then system can make decisions for commodity futures and stock trading accordingly.</p><h4 id="Potential-and-Applications"><a href="#Potential-and-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Potential and Applications"></a>Potential and Applications</h4><p>SVM was very popular in the 90s. There were SVM applications everywhere, image recognition, speech recognition and so on. The stock market is no exception. It is popular to use SVM algorithms to make predictions for stock markets in the United States, Japan, China, India, and more.</p><p>As early as 2004, there were reports of using SVM models to predict the Nikkei index. The data set is the changing trend of Nikkei 225 index from 1990 to 2002 years. It uses two data features; one is the S&amp;P 500 index and the other is the exchange rate of the yen and the us dollar. The accuracy is 73%. </p><p>Many years later, there also have reports that using data set from 2000 to 2012 to forecast Nasdaq index, Dow Jones index and S&amp;P 500 index [4].<br>In this SVM prediction model, there are three inputs to predict these three indices: </p><ol><li>Index changes in other national markets. Such as the Nikkei index, the Hang Seng index and so on. </li><li>Changes of foreign exchange. Such as changes in the Euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, etc. </li><li>Changes in commodity prices. Such as gold, silver, oil price changes.<br>Enter the above data set into the SVM model input, and then select the features. In this report, there are totally 12 features and four most important features of them were selected. After training and testing, it is finally possible to make a judgment on the rise or fall trend of these three indices. The Nasdaq index accuracy is 74%. The Dow Jones index accuracy is 77% and the S&amp;P index accuracy is 76%. </li></ol><p>In 2013, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications also applied this kind of machine learning to algorithmic trading on a large scale [5]. Its machine learning model runs in the quantitative model runtime module, trying to identify investment opportunities from large-scale data, and automatically complete the purchase and sale of securities through the program order module.</p><p>Since then, more sophisticated and complex models have emerged. It can be seen that in the field of algorithmic trading, machine learning, a powerful tool, has gradually become mainstream. Machine learning has gradually become a good choice for traders to improve trading speed, reduce operational errors, and reduce market friction.</p><h3 id="Prospect-and-Limitations"><a href="#Prospect-and-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Prospect and Limitations"></a>Prospect and Limitations</h3><p>Machine learning is widely used in algorithmic trading. Perhaps in the near future it will even be possible to apply general artificial intelligence to algorithmic trading.<br>Researchers of AI generally agree that the following qualities are necessary for an intelligence:<br>• Automatic reasoning, the use of strategies to solve problems, decisions made in uncertain environments;<br>• Knowledge representation, including common sense knowledge bases;<br>• Automatic programming;<br>• Self-directed learning, innovation;<br>• Communication using natural language;<br>• Integrating the above function to achieve a specific goal; and more.</p><p>Some tools have emerged that can automatically deduce the best solution, such as Google’s DeepMind. Google has made the most progress in this area. It aims to successfully develop a general thinking machine that can solve any problem. Google calls its human-like brain neural program “general artificial intelligence technology”. And the word “general” means that this is a general intelligence that can be “evolved” automatically.</p><p>In my opinion, General AI is possible only after various specialized AIs are completely developed and after finding a efficient method to integrate the data of different AI functions. From the perspective of algorithmic trading, for example, the AI responsible for semantic recognition can find useful news and financial information from the Internet; the AI responsible for reasoning and analysis will calculate and quantify the impact of various news and information on the market; the AI responsible for integration will integrate and compare the analysis results with the predictions after machine learning, and re-output a more precise result. Furthermore, I think ethics, privacy and policy are also issues that need to be considered and solved in advance. </p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><p>[1] <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html</a>, Mitchell, T., Machine Learning, McGraw Hill, 1997<br>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading</a>, Algorithmic trading from Wikipedia<br>[3] <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1030913">https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1030913</a>, Machine Learning Application for Quantitative Investing - Timing Trading Strategy for Commodity Futures Based on SVM Model, 2018<br>[4] <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1059055">https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1059055</a>, Application of machine learning in the algorithmic trading, 2018<br>[5] Chen Ziqiang.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="\assets\css\APlayer.min.css"><script src="\assets\js\APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><script class="meting-secondary-script-marker" src="\assets\js\Meting.min.js"></script><h2 id="一些有关TSM和GDPR的问题"><a href="#一些有关TSM和GDPR的问题" class="headerlink" title="一些有关TSM和GDPR的问题"></a>一些有关TSM和GDPR的问题</h2><h3 id="1-a-Telecoms-Single-Market-TSM"><a href="#1-a-Telecoms-Single-Market-TSM" class="headerlink" title="1(a) Telecoms Single Market (TSM)"></a>1(a) Telecoms Single Market (TSM)</h3><p>The Telecommunications Single Market first mentioned as a regulation adopted by the European Union in 2015. And it aims to provide an “open Internet” by requiring telecom operators to treat all Internet traffic equally[1]. In another word, the Telecoms Single Market means no discrimination across borders[2].<br>The Digital Single Market is a strategy proposed by the European Commission in 2015 which intend to remove virtual borders, boost digital connectivity, and make it easier for consumers to access cross-border online content[3]. TSM is the foundation of this strategy.</p><h3 id="1-b-GDPR-and-TSM-relationship"><a href="#1-b-GDPR-and-TSM-relationship" class="headerlink" title="1(b) GDPR and TSM relationship"></a>1(b) GDPR and TSM relationship</h3><p>Both TSM and GDPR are the basis for the implementation of the DSM strategy[4].<br>TSM is about regulating telecom operators to make the digital information transport easier between different areas, while the GDPR protects the rights of consumers (natural persons) by regulating the organizations’ behaviors.<br>For their purposes, the two are the same. For their results, both have transformed the market environment better.</p><h3 id="2-a-Limited-for-its-purpose"><a href="#2-a-Limited-for-its-purpose" class="headerlink" title="2(a) Limited for its purpose"></a>2(a) Limited for its purpose</h3><p>Organizations should only collect necessary personal data for a specific purpose [5]. And they must clearly state what that purpose is. If the organization want to use personal data for the other purposes, it will need to get the permission from the user separately[6].</p><h3 id="2-b-Necessary-and-compatible"><a href="#2-b-Necessary-and-compatible" class="headerlink" title="2(b) Necessary and compatible"></a>2(b) Necessary and compatible</h3><p>As said above, the organizations should only collect data for as long as necessary to complete their shown purpose.<br>Furthermore, when the organizations or staff dealing with a certain process, they should be given only the necessary data to achieve its processing purposes[6]. Meanwhile, these data must be enough related with the processor and the processing purpose.</p><h3 id="2-c-Storage-limitation"><a href="#2-c-Storage-limitation" class="headerlink" title="2(c) Storage limitation"></a>2(c) Storage limitation</h3><p>Organizations need to delete personal data when it is no longer necessary. Alternatively, the personal data should be anonymized or modified until it no longer relates to individual[5].<br>The definition of the period of ‘no longer necessary’ above will vary between industries and the reasons that data is collected. This period is usually acceptable if it is logical and reasonable.  Meanwhile, the organizations should record and show these reasons properly[6].<br>However, this period should also refer to the record[7] that established by IGA in 2016. This gives the organizations a reference standard. </p><h3 id="2-d-Integrity-and-confidentiality"><a href="#2-d-Integrity-and-confidentiality" class="headerlink" title="2(d) Integrity and confidentiality"></a>2(d) Integrity and confidentiality</h3><p>Organizations should arrange security measures to protect the personal data from unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.<br>Furthermore, more attention should be paid to special categories of data, which require a greater level of protection due to their sensitive nature[6].</p><h3 id="3-a-Privacy-by-Design"><a href="#3-a-Privacy-by-Design" class="headerlink" title="3(a) Privacy by Design"></a>3(a) Privacy by Design</h3><p>Privacy by design is a systems engineering approach that aims to ensure protection for the privacy of individuals. It considerate the privacy issues integrally from the very beginning of the development of products, services, business practices, and physical infrastructures[8].<br>This approach can provide a systematic overview of the personal privacy so that the organizations can avoid many security problems and reduce many risks at the beginning, while the users can control their personal data more efficiently and comprehensively.</p><h3 id="3-b-Pseudonymization"><a href="#3-b-Pseudonymization" class="headerlink" title="3(b) Pseudonymization"></a>3(b) Pseudonymization</h3><p>The pseudonym is an identifier associated with an individual. Pseudonymization technology is a kind of privacy engineering technology that allows users to use pseudonyms to switch between using personal data and using anonymous data.<br>Pseudonymization reduces the risk of being directly identified by personal data and exposing sensitive data to unauthorized people and employees[9].<br>The pseudonymization technique is reversible compared with another privacy technology, that recommended by GDPR, anonymization, which will irreversibly alter the data, meaning that users can also access the data through the “keys” after the pseudonymization. At the same time, this feature also makes regulation much more easier than the anonymization[10].</p><h3 id="4-a-Exemptions-from-PDPA"><a href="#4-a-Exemptions-from-PDPA" class="headerlink" title="4(a) Exemptions from PDPA"></a>4(a) Exemptions from PDPA</h3><p>As a response of the GDPR, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) actually supplemented the original regulations.<br>However, it generally does not apply to[11]: </p><ol><li>Individuals acting in either a domestic or personal capacity.</li><li>Public agencies.</li><li>Employees performing actions in the context of their employment with a particular business or organization.</li><li>Government agencies.</li><li>Any other organization or category if personal data that may be prescribed.</li></ol><h3 id="4-b-DPO-and-PDPC"><a href="#4-b-DPO-and-PDPC" class="headerlink" title="4(b) DPO and PDPC"></a>4(b) DPO and PDPC</h3><p>A Data Protection Officer (DPO) plays an important role in company or organization. They must ensure that the company’s policy meets with PDPA guidelines. They have responsibility of turning data protection into a competitive advantage for the company as well, which would lead to building trust in the wider data ecosystem[12][13].<br>Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) provides a baseline standard of protection, PDPA, for personal data in Singapore. It includes various requirements governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data in Singapore[14].<br>In a word, PDPC provides the basic requirement and standard of the organizations’ policy and then it plays a role of ruler and punishes the organizations that violate the regulations. While the DPO whom plays an agent role in the organization will help build the specifical policy that suit with their own and then keep both policy and data healthy.</p><h3 id="4-c-DNC-registry-for-telemarketing"><a href="#4-c-DNC-registry-for-telemarketing" class="headerlink" title="4(c) DNC registry for telemarketing"></a>4(c) DNC registry for telemarketing</h3><p>PDPC also provides for the establishment of a national Do Not Call (DNC) Registry[15].<br>Individuals can register their phone number on the DNC Registry website first. All the registered phone numbers will be collected and reserved safely. When some organizations want to send messages or other forms of promotion, they must compare the target phone number with the registered list that provided by DNC Registry. If that Phone number is on the list, the message will be forbidden to send.<br>The DNC Registry provisions came into force on 2 January 2014 and the main data protection rules on 2 July. From then on, when the organization trying telemarketing, they are forced to firstly check the target user whether willing to receive the promotion or not[16].<br>From the perspective of the PDPC, DNC Registry is an important part of the realization of PDPA, and it promotes each other with PDPA.<br>DNC takes the needs of consumers into consideration, which is a significant manifestation of people’s right to personal private data. It also prevents organizations from over-promoting without considering to user privacy.</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><p>[1] <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/sectors/electronic-communications/related-topics_en">https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/sectors/electronic-communications/related-topics_en</a><br>[2] <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2015-028_gbe-telecom_single_market_trilogue-key_beuc_demands.pdf">https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2015-028_gbe-telecom_single_market_trilogue-key_beuc_demands.pdf</a><br>[3] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Single_Market">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Single_Market</a><br>[4] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation</a><br>[5] <a href="https://itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-gdpr-understanding-the-6-data-protection-principles">https://itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-gdpr-understanding-the-6-data-protection-principles</a><br>[6] <a href="https://www.qcs.co.uk/six-principles-of-gdpr">https://www.qcs.co.uk/six-principles-of-gdpr</a><br>[7] <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1202/Records-Management-Code-of-Practice-for-Health-and-Social-Care-2016">https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1202/Records-Management-Code-of-Practice-for-Health-and-Social-Care-2016</a><br>[8] <a href="https://medium.com/golden-data/what-is-privacy-by-design-pbd-9a3e4d96536a">https://medium.com/golden-data/what-is-privacy-by-design-pbd-9a3e4d96536a</a><br>[9] <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/pseudonymization-according-to-the-gdpr">https://dataprivacymanager.net/pseudonymization-according-to-the-gdpr</a><br>[10] <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-pseudonymization">https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-pseudonymization</a><br>[11] <a href="https://caseguard.com/articles/singapores-personal-data-protection-act-or-pdpa">https://caseguard.com/articles/singapores-personal-data-protection-act-or-pdpa</a><br>[12] <a href="https://sleek.com/sg/resources/what-is-a-data-protection-officer-dpo">https://sleek.com/sg/resources/what-is-a-data-protection-officer-dpo</a><br>[13] <a href="https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/Data-Protection/Business-Owner/Data-Protection-Officers">https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/Data-Protection/Business-Owner/Data-Protection-Officers</a><br>[14] <a href="https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/The-Legislation/Personal-Data-Protection-Act">https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/The-Legislation/Personal-Data-Protection-Act</a><br>[15] <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/PDPA2012-S709-2013?DocDate=20150529">https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/PDPA2012-S709-2013?DocDate=20150529</a><br>[16] <a href="https://www.dnc.gov.sg/index.html">https://www.dnc.gov.sg/index.html</a></p>]]></content>

It simulates human behaviour or thinking and can be trained to solve specific problems.<br>AI models are usually trained using ‘Big data’, and they have the ability to make intelligent decisions. </p><p>Computational Finance is a branch of applied computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance. In another word, it exploits synergy by applying advanced computing to finance &amp; economics. As AI developed, computational finance came to rely on algorithms and ‘Big Data’.</p><p>CS perspective computation is challenging classical finance. In the classical economics theory, there are 3 assumptions that not very practical. If these assumptions hold, much of computer science &amp; artificial intelligence is not worth studying or irrelevant.<br>On one hand, classical economics take computation for granted, not even an issue. On the other, computation in CS perspective computation is vital but very limited, which has more ‘Intractable’ problems, and sacrifices the optimality and completeness. From this perspective, they complement each other’s deficiencies and the computation is more of a powerful tool for perfecting and correcting classical finance.</p><p>For traders, finding the hidden opportunity is the target. The computers are fast and useful to lend some help. For traders themselves, they need more knowledge besides finance and economics. To beat competitors, traders also need good knowledge of algorithms. Some algorithms &amp; heuristics can help traders to find better solutions while some are faster than others. The factors ignored by classical economics usually need to be considered.</p><h2 id="机翻"><a href="#机翻" class="headerlink" title="机翻"></a>机翻</h2><p>AI是机器显示的智能。它模拟人类的行为或思维，可以训练解决特定问题。<br>AI模型通常使用”大数据”进行训练，并且具有做出智能决策的能力。 </p><p>计算金融学是应用计算机科学的一个分支，处理金融学中实际感兴趣的问题。换句话说，它通过将先进的计算应用于金融和经济来利用协同作用。随着人工智能的发展，计算金融开始依赖算法和”大数据” </p><p>CS视角计算正在挑战经典金融。在古典经济学理论中，有3个不是很实用的假设。如果这些假设成立，那么计算机科学和人工智能的大部分内容就不值得研究或无关紧要。<br>一方面，古典经济学认为计算是理所当然的，甚至不是一个问题。另一方面，CS计算视角下的计算至关重要，它的计算能力十分有限，会出现很多的”棘手”问题，并牺牲了最优性和完整性。从这个角度来看，它们相互补充了彼此的不足，计算更像是完善和纠正经典金融的有力工具。计算机速度快，很有用，可以提供一些帮助。</p><p>对于交易者本身来说，除了金融和经济学之外，他们还需要更多的知识。为了击败竞争对手，交易者还需要对算法有很好的了解。一些算法和启发式算法可以帮助交易者找到更好的解决方案，而有些算法和启发式算法比其他算法更快。古典经济学所忽略的因素通常需要考虑。</p>]]></content>
